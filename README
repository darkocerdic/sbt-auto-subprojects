This project is an example how to automatically add new sbt subprojects.
Any subfolder that is added to apps folder will become a new project.
It will receive a dependency to "common" subproject.
The main project will also receive a dependency to any new supbroject.
Look at project/build.scala and project/project/build.scala to see how this is implemented.
